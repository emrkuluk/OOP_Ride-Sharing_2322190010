## Project Description
This project is a Python-based ride-sharing simulation that manages drivers, passengers, and ride requests using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Development Stages
Although all final codes are in the main directory for easier execution, the project was developed in three distinct stages:

1. **Stage 1 (Architecture & Design):** - Core entities are defined in `models.py`.
   - Utility functions and the `Location` class are defined in `utils.py`.
   - **Concepts:** Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Composition.

2. **Stage 2 (Basic Implementation):** - Basic ride logic, fare estimation, and nearest driver search are implemented in `service.py`.

3. **Stage 3 (Advanced Algorithms & Analytics):** - **Optimization:** An "Optimized Driver Matching" (Greedy Algorithm) was implemented to minimize passenger waiting time.
   - **Analytics:** Advanced system reports (Average Trip Duration, Satisfaction Index) were added.
   - **Simulation:** Controlled via `main.py`.

## How to Run the Project
To see the system and algorithms in action, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python main.py
